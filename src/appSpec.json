The `'secondary'` color (electric lime) is a decorative accent; use it for graphical flourishes like borders, sticker backgrounds, or icon backdrops. Do NOT use the `'secondary'` color for text on the `'background'`, as it lacks contrast. Instead, use `'secondaryForeground'` for any text placed on top of `'secondary'` elements. The `'subtleDivider'` is used for horizontal rules that separate content sections without adding visual weight.",

The `'brandAccent'` (rust orange) on `'background'` meets WCAG AA standards for normal text and AAA for large text, making it safe for headlines and links. The `'secondary'` color (lime green) does NOT meet contrast standards against `'background'` and must be restricted to non-text graphical elements or backgrounds.

The 'background' color serves as the main canvas for content. Use the 'secondary' color (white) specifically for overlay cards, content containers, or distinct sections that sit on top of images or darker backgrounds.

The `'brandAccent'` is the functional highlight color; use it for primary headlines, text links, and active states to draw the eye to key information. The `'secondary'` color (electric lime) is a decorative accent; use it for graphical flourishes like borders, sticker backgrounds, or icon backdrops. Do NOT use the `'secondary'` color for text on the `'background'`, as it lacks contrast. Instead, use `'secondaryForeground'` for any text placed on top of `'secondary'` elements. The `'subtleDivider'` is used for horizontal rules that separate content sections without adding visual weight.",
      "paletteAccessibilityNotes": "The combination of `'primary'` (black) and `'background'` (white) provides excellent AAA contrast. The `'brandAccent'` (rust orange) on `'background'` meets WCAG AA standards for normal text and AAA for large text, making it safe for headlines and links. The `'secondary'` color (lime green) does NOT meet contrast standards against `'background'` and must be restricted to non-text graphical elements or backgrounds. Text placed on top of the `'secondary'` color must use `'secondaryForeground'` (black) to ensure high readability."
